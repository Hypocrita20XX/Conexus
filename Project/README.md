### Please Read!
*In this directory (Conexus/Projects) you'll find working code, NOT release code. This is just where I store my local project files so that I don't risk losing everything in the case of unforseen events. Release versions, and subsequent source code specific to that release, can be found [in the releases section](https://github.com/Hypocrita20XX/Conexus/releases)*<br/><br/>

*Very basic setup if you want to dive into the code*<br/>
*You'll need to install [Ookii.Dialogs](https://github.com/augustoproiete/ookii-dialogs-wpf/tree/master/src/Ookii.Dialogs.Wpf), [Extended WPF Toolkit](https://github.com/xceedsoftware/wpftoolkit), and [Peanut Butter INI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeanutButter.INI/) via the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.*<br/>
*You'll also need Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition installed. This is what Conexus was developed with, and I can't promise successful compilation using any other version.*<br/>
*Lastly, Conexus was developed with Windows 10, so I can't help with any other operation system.*
