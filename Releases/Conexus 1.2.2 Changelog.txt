Conexus 1.2.2 Changlog
- Log saved more often, to hopefully catch any possible breaks
- Better debug info in logs: includes OS, mode, and method used

- Added exception handling in a lot of places (more plainly, Conexus should crash gracefully most of the time and recover without much issue)

- Fixed odd creation of "_DD_TextFiles" folder outside of game's root directory
- Fixed odd creation of "Select Mods Directory" folder in Conexus' root directory

- Greatly expanded logging and saving of the log file
- Implemented log tags:
- INFO: general info
- PROC: Conexus has processed something
- INPUT: User provided some kind of input
- VERIFY: some user-specific info was verified
- WARN: problems arose, but program did not break
- ERROR: problems arose and program was going to break
