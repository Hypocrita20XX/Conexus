Conexus 1.2.2 Changlog
- Log now saves much more often, to hopefully catch any possible breaks
- Better debug info in logs: includes OS, mode, and method used

- Added exception handling in a lot of places (more plainly, Conexus should crash gracefully most of the time and recover without much issue)
- Added mode memory: Conexus will detect that you've downloaded mods, and will set the mode to update on next startup

- Fixed odd creation of "_DD_TextFiles" folder outside of game's root directory
- Fixed odd creation of "Select Mods Directory" folder in Conexus' root directory

- Greatly expanded logging and saving of the log file
- Implemented log tags:
- INFO: General info
- PROC: Conexus is, will, or has processed something
- INPUT: User provided some kind of input
- VERIFY: Some user-specific info was verified
- WARN: Problems arose, but program did not break
- ERROR: Problems arose, program was going to break, but was able to recover

- Performance should not suffer from these changes, but it might in specific situations (IE your computer is already taxed)
