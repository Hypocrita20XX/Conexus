Conexus Changelog 1.3.1:
> Merged modes (download/update) and simplified overall operation
> Adjusted UI to acommodate this change
> Made log window bigger to keep overall window the same size

> Cleaned up XML, specifically comments, adding/changing/removing
> Cleaned up CS, again comments, removed version tags, started to feel like it was more bloat than help

> Log window should now properly scroll to the bottom of the window with each new window
