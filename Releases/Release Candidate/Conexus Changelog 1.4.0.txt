Conexus Changelog 1.4.0:
> Merged modes (download/update) and simplified overall operation
> Adjusted UI to acommodate this change
> Made log window bigger to keep overall window the same size

> Cleaned up XML, specifically comments, adding/changing/removing
> Cleaned up CS, again comments, removed version tags, started to feel like it was more bloat than help

> Log window should now properly scroll to the bottom of the window with each new window
> New log tag, DEBUG, to hopefully help you with specific troubleshooting steps

> Changed log level in generic exception from WARNING to ERROR

> Added lengthy debug/diagnostics when SteamCMD fails to download mods
> When this happens, it's going to be a giant wall of text with hopefully useful info that can get you back up and running
