Conexus Changelog 1.4.0
Highlights:
> New download verification and diagnostics
> Modes have been merged and are now handled automatically
> Methods have been merged and are now handled automatically
> Links method now supports mod names and is overall more flexible
> Added diagnostics when mods fail to download

Details:
> Merged modes (download/update), both are now handled automatically
> Merged methods (collection/list), provide a URL to use a collection, if none is given, Links.txt will be used
> Adjusted UI to acommodate these changes
> Made log window bigger to keep overall window the same size

> Cleaned up XML, specifically comments, adding/changing/removing
> Cleaned up CS, again comments, removed version tags, felt more like bloat than help

> Log window should now properly scroll to the bottom of the window with each new window
> New log tag, DEBUG, to hopefully help with specific troubleshooting steps
> Changed log level in generic exception from WARNING to ERROR (because this only happens when everything irreparably breaks)
> Removed duplicate log message
> Corrected spelling in certain log messages

> Added lengthy debug/diagnostics when SteamCMD fails to download mods
> Added download verification that complements the aforementioned diagnostics
> Conexus will now try twice to download mods
> If more than 1/4th of your list fails to download, Conexus will stop processing mods (to account for hidden mods)

> Removed deleting mods in \262060, to save users of large mods lists time with subsequent use of Conexus

> Changed check for Links.txt, from * to "steamcommunity", should be less error-prone
> This means you don't need to preface comments with an asterisk starting with this version
> Changed how the asterisk works, it now denotes mod names
> Links file is now much more flexible, and can be formatting in a variety of ways
> Implemented a character limit of 120 for the mod name, windows supports upwards of 260, but that seems excessive for this
> Make sure your mod name comes before the link, otherwise odd stuff can/will happen

> Changed data saving, if you delete the URL after a saved URL is loaded, it will be deleted from the config when you close Conexus

> Added data text file verification (for HTML, Mods, and ModInfo in \Data and \Links)
> Added missing exception handling when downloading HTML from source
