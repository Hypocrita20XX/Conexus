Conexus Changelog 1.4.0
Highlights:
> New download verification and diagnostics
> Modes have been merged and are now handled automatically

Details:
> Merged modes (download/update) and simplified overall operation
> Adjusted UI to acommodate this change
> Made log window bigger to keep overall window the same size

> Cleaned up XML, specifically comments, adding/changing/removing
> Cleaned up CS, again comments, removed version tags, felt more like bloat than help

> Log window should now properly scroll to the bottom of the window with each new window
> New log tag, DEBUG, to hopefully help with specific troubleshooting steps

> Changed log level in generic exception from WARNING to ERROR

> Added lengthy debug/diagnostics when SteamCMD fails to download mods
> Added download verification that complements the aforementioned diagnostics
> Conexus will now try twice to download mods
> If more than 1/4th of your list fails to download, Conexus will stop processing mods (to account for hidden mods)

> Removed duplicate log message
> Corrected spelling in certain log messages

> Removed deleting mods in \262060, to save users of large mods lists time with subsequent use of Conexus

> Changed check for Links.txt, from asterisk to steamcommunity, should be less error-prone
> This means you don't need to preface comments with an asterisk starting with this version
> Changed how the asterisk works, it now denotes mod names
> Links file is now much more flexible, and can be formatting in a variety of ways
