Welcome to Conexus!
Lost? You've come to the right place!
Let me give you a rundown of the functionality Conexus currently has.

Conexus can:
Download/update mods from a Steam collection
Download/update mods from a list given in a text file


Please note, you need to have SteamCMD installed for Conexus to work
Please see https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD for more info!
As of v1.2.0, Epic and GOG are not supported, see https://github.com/Hypocrita20XX/Conexus/issues/11 for more info


Let's go over the details!

Downloading/updating from a Steam collection:
> You'll need a URL to any Steam collection, but that Steam collection has to either be unlisted or public.
  If the collection is hidden or set to friends-only, Conexus sadly can't read that collection.
> Copy/paste that url to the right of where it says "Collection URL"
> Next, you need to provide the location of SteamCMD and Darkest Dungeon's mod directory.
  Just click on each of the "Select Directory" buttons and you'll be presented with a file browser
  that will let you navigate to each location.
> After that, ensure that "Steam Collection" is selected 
  from the dropdown menu to the right of "Organize Mods"
> Provide your Steam username and password, don't worry, this is only used by SteamCMD and is not saved!
> Finally, hit the "Organize Mods" button and Conexus will get to work!

Downloading/updating from a list of links:
> This method is a bit more manual, sadly. Navigate to Documents\Conexus\Links
  and if you've already run Conexus, there will be a file named Links.txt. 
  If it isn't there, just make one and name it Links.txt (the name is very important)
> Enter each mod's URL on one line, you can also add a comment using * (for instance, *Amazing Mod Name)
  Great to organize your mods, so you don't have to guess what each link is!
> Once you've done that, make sure that "List" is selected 
  in the dropdown menu to the right of "Organize Mods"
> Provide your Steam username and password, don't worry this is only used by SteamCMD and is not saved!
> Hit the "Organize Mods" button and you're good to go!


Important notes:
> As of v1.2.0: you will need your Steam Credentials to use Conexus.
> As of v1.2.0: Conexus has a log window that will show you what he's working on and when.

> As of v1.3.0: Conexus will not save your Steam credentials, but they can be added to the new config.ini if you would like
> As of v1.3.0: Conexus now saves all data to Documents\Conexus, \Config, \Data, \Links, and \Logs

> As of v1.4.0: There's no longer a dropdown for modes, downloading/updating, but functionally everything should work the same.
 
> If you're using the list of links method, please keep in mind that the result will not include
  the mod's name (005_123123123 as opposed to 005_123123123_Awesome Mod Name when using the Steam collection method)
