# Welcome To Conexus!
*Conexus is an all-in-one tool to convert a Steam collection into a load order for the game [Darkest Dungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest_Dungeon/).* 

## Your Load Order, Simplified
*If you've modded Darkest Dungeon for any length of time, you've more than likely discovered that the in-game UI breaks after an unknown  amount of mods are loaded in.*  

**Enter Conexus...** </br>
![Conexus GUI](https://github.com/Hypocrita20XX/Conexus/blob/master/Images/GUI.png)</br>

*With the help of a straightforward GUI, Conexus will anaylze your Steam collection, download or update those mods (you can do both!) and then move those folders to the correct location with names that you can understand, and that the game will read in the exact order your Steam collection is in.*</br>
*Updating your mods with Conexus is just as easy. Just let him know you want to update, and he'll move your mods to the proper location, update them, and move them back for you, all with the same user-friendly names.*</br>

### Disclaimers
*Please keep in mind that Conexus was developed on a machine running Windows 10. I don't have any experience with Linux or Mac, and cannot provide support for those operating systems. Thanks to the [license](https://github.com/Hypocrita20XX/Conexus/blob/master/LICENSE) though, feel free to modify the code to create builds for those platforms! Just be sure to link back here, I would appreciate it.*

### Requirements
* *A legitimate copy of [Darkest Dungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest_Dungeon/)*
* *[SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD)*

### Setup
* *You'll need to get SteamCMD up and running, go ahead and download it, then I would recommend extracting to C:\SteamCMD, or any other drive/location you would prefer. Best not to have spaces though.*
* *To get all the necessary files downloaded, you'll need to open the command prompt (Windows key + R, type in "cmd.")*
* *Once you've done that, type "cd: <location of steamcmd>"*
* *Next, type "steamcmd" and hit enter, SteamCMD should do its thing!*
* *Lastly, you'll need to download the latest [release}(https://github.com/Hypocrita20XX/Conexus/releases) of Conexus, it'll save to C:\Conexus by default*
